      <h1>Importing and Exporting Components</h1>
      <p>
        The magic of components lies in their reusability: you can create
        components that are composed of other components. But as you nest more
        and more components, it often makes sense to start splitting them into
        different files. This lets you keep your files easy to scan and reuse
        components in more places.
